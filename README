I used Node.js as a language of choice to implement the requested functionalities in Assignment 3 Q1. Here are the steps to follow for the initial setup:

1- Make sure you have Node in your pc. You can use this link to download both Node and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/download

2- You can check if the node is installed correctly using the command "node -v" which shows the current Node version being used.

3- After downloading the Node, you need to install "pg" npm package running this command "npm i pg" in the termninal (NPM should already be included in Node you 've downloaded).
  - here is the official page of the package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg
  - pg package allows us to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

4- "schema.sql" file contains the initial sql statements for creating the "students" table and inserting the initial data. Make sure you run these before testing any functions.

5- If you are done with the initial setup above, you can just run the command "node db.js" to start the execution of the javascript file.

6- To test the functions, you can just uncomment the functions calls that I already wrote, save the file and run the "node db.js" command again.

7- Remember after every change you make on the file (uncommenting functions you want to test etc.), you need to save the file and execute the script again using "node db.js".
